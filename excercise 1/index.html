        <h1>Interneting Is Easy!</h1>
        <p>first, we need to learn some basic HHTML</p>

        <h2>Heading</h2>
        <p> Headings define the outling of your site. there are six levels of headings. </p>

        <h2>List</h2>
        <P>this is how we make an unorder List</P>

        <ul>
            <li>Add a "ul" element ( it stand for un order list</li>
            <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
            <li>They don't need to be in any particular order</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Ordered/Numbered List</h2>
        <p> This is how we make an ordered list</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Notice the "ol" element wrapping everything?</li>
                <li>But, the list item element are the same</li>
                <li>Also note how numbers increment on their own</li>
                <li> We should be noticing things in precise order, 
                     because this is an order list</li>

            </ol>

            <h2> Inline Elements</h2>
            <p>
                <em>Sometimes</em> we need to draw attention to a particular world or phrase.
            </p>
            <p>
                Other times, we need to <strong>strongly</strong> 
                emphasize the importance of a world of phrase
            </p>

            <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
            <p>Thanks for reading! Learning HTML should be getting easier now.</p>
